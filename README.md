# TelescopeTracking
DIY telescope tracking, both hardware files (gears) and software files should be included. Done on two Arduinos, one Uno one Mega.

This repo is currently incomplete as I am still in the process of finishing the design, build, and code. What is uploaded is across more files than it needs to be and may be incoherent, uncommented, or not working. Currently just a backup incase I somehow lose my hard drive. Will clean up and make sure everything is functional, readable, and commented on once this project is finished.
